# Robot-Arm-Rig

This project involves creating a complete rig in Autodesk Maya for a mechanical arm, including bones, controllers, and skinning. After rigging the arm, a 250-frame animation sequence was created and rendered. The rendered footage was then edited in Adobe Premiere Pro for post-processing and assembled into a short demo reel video.
Tools Used



## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a functional rig for a mechanical arm in Autodesk Maya and animate it to showcase its movement and flexibility. The process involved several steps:

Rigging: Once the model was downloaded, a rig was built using a combination of bones, controllers, and skinning to allow the arm to move realistically.

Animation: With the rig complete, an animation sequence was created to showcase the arm's movement and functionality.

Rendering: After the animation was complete, a render sequence of 250 frames was created using Arnold render.

Post-processing: The rendered footage was then imported into Adobe Premiere Pro for post-processing and editing.

Final Output: The final output was a short demo reel video showcasing the arm's movement and flexibility.
